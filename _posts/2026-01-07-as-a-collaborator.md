From the start of my undergrad, I've been consistently engaged in collaboration across curiculum teamwork, research projects and beyond. However, it's not until recently that I truly and deeply felt that how much I suck as a collaborator, which is because of a severe academic accident.

Here I would like to share some experiences and try to summarize some common issue beneath all the failure, and hopefully learn my lesson and grow up as a good collaborator.

## Paper submission
Recently our research team summitted a paper to a conference, and my supervisor asked me to complete **my own author form**. I instead resubmit the same paper as a duplication without informing him, or leting him give me instructions on how and where to complete my form. I thought that was my form to complete. 

When the sumbission ddl passed, after roughly 3 hours, he reached me in emergency and told me that I ran into big trouble, which could potentially harm all the other collaborators on the author list. 

I regret out of question. I regret why I did not ask him about how and where to complete the form, or if I had correctly completed my task as demanded. Even if I know the procedure, I should have double checked it with him about it, let alone me being a newbie to paper submission. 

If it's some campus thesis, careless resubmission might be forgiven. But it's a international conference with rigorously specified rules. Any mistakes, whether on purpose or not, will be considered a violation of rule. We might get away this time if we contact the committee timely and honestly, but a green hand should on no occasion do virtually anything without carefullt inquery a senior author. 

As I regret, I come to realize that this accident is essentially due to my lack of communication and alignment with my collaborators. As I begin to recall my previous research project experiences, I found this a common pattern across all of them. 

## Research intern
Currently I'm doing intern somewhere mentored by a postdoc. We just had a meeting yesterday, and I talked about how I move inefficiently in this project without asking for help or getting satisfying experimental results. He kind of pointed out some missing ingradients. 

First, before this meeting, our last meeting was held ~3 weeks ago. At that time we already had a quite clear to-do list. What I need to do is basically doing experiments and surveying literatures as the list says. But I seemed to be extremely interested in diverging from the conventional path: before I finish the to-dos step by step, I jumped out and change our codebase significantly and tried some new architectures, expecting it to work. When it turns out to be a failure, I just realized that I haven't finished my old jobs, which could provide more guidance on future progress, like excluding or verifying some of our assumptions, serving as powerful proof that XX doesn't work. Like my mentor says, now we don't even have a convincing proof that XX doesn't work, because you changed multiple variables at one time.

By now we haven't laid a solid foundation for analysing root causes, so the solution seems still distant. If I had discussed with him once I found out that XX didn't work, or prepared to try my new notion, he would give proper advice, telling me if it's beneficial for our follow-up research. Of course you can diverge and try out new ideas, but that's based on the fact that I had conducted all the required experiments and make sure they don't work, and find some hint that guide me towards this trial. Of course that might be a tough skill for a undergrad like me to master in a short time, and that's where discussion comes in.

Previously in Hong Kong, I experienced somthing similar. Each time I would report a chunk of things I did without thinking if it's reasonable or not. And then leave it to my my mentor to try to understand what I did and its meaning, and decide what's the next move. Timely report has become somewhat a luxury, either because I dont think there's much to deliver, or I feel reluctant to sort out and come up with the right questions.

Reflecting on that, I think it's really irresponsible behaviors, and consumes my energy and passion quickly.

## Major weaknesses
As such, I think it necessary to summarize some major weaknesses that exists across these collaborations, and needs to be eliminated.

### Communicate with your collaborators
Dont be constrained by any factors, and give communication and alignment top priority. It' better to ask redundant questions than not asking necessary questions. Plus, short-interval and constant discussion might be better. Sometimes you dont want waste time on unsubstantial discussions because there really has nothing to discuss. In that case, set a time limit, like 1 week.

Normally, when you finished what's on the to-do list, there will be much to discuss.

### Do planned jobs before unplanned jobs
After discussion the first execution must be verifying the proposed notions. Based on that you can do some other things before the next meeting/discussion.

### Do solid things, Dont be greedy
Maybe I am so greedy to produce promising results, that I just didn't treat basic stuffs carefully. And when I deliver it, it seems not convincing enough, either because I'm still unclear about the details, or I just didn't complete the experiments.

## TBD
I had a intuition that there's gonna be a lot more to learn concerning collaboration. Hopefully I can keep updating and exploring the philosophy/art of collaborations.
